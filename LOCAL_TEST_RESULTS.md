## Critical Fix Applied

### Issue
Static files were not being served in production because the path resolution was incorrect.

### Root Cause
In `server/_core/vite.ts`, the production path was:
```typescript
path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "..", "public")
```

When running `node dist/index.js`:
- `import.meta.dirname` = `/home/ubuntu/hockey-dev-tracker/dist`
- Resolved path = `/home/ubuntu/hockey-dev-tracker/public` ❌ (doesn't exist)

### Solution
Changed to:
```typescript
path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "public")
```

Now resolves to:
- `/home/ubuntu/hockey-dev-tracker/dist/public` ✅ (correct location)

### Verification
- ✅ Diagnostic logging shows correct path
- ✅ All static assets serve with HTTP 200
- ✅ Correct content-types for CSS and JS
- ✅ No 404 errors

## Performance Metrics

### Build Time
- **Vite build**: 4.77s
- **esbuild**: 8ms
- **Total**: ~5s

### Bundle Sizes
- **Server**: 84 KB
- **HTML**: 349 KB (includes inline runtime)
- **CSS**: 130 KB (gzipped: 19.91 KB)
- **JavaScript**: 596 KB (gzipped: 172.34 KB)

### Startup Time
- **Server ready**: < 1 second
- **Health check response**: < 50ms

---

## Warnings (Non-Critical)

### Bundle Size Warning
```
Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification
```

**Impact**: Slower initial page load  
**Severity**: Low (warning only, not an error)  
**Recommendation**: Implement code splitting in future (optional optimization)

## Environment Variables Tested

### Required
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=production`
- ✅ `PORT=3000`
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` (placeholder for test)
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET`

### Optional (Not Tested)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (AI features)
- `AWS_*` (S3 video storage)
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_*` (Analytics)

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Get Supabase Database Password**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kqdcikqnyatyyfpobrzt
   - Copy connection string

2. **Choose Deployment Platform**
   - Railway (recommended)
   - Render
   - Fly.io

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   JWT_SECRET=<generate-32-char-string>
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Platform will auto-detect configuration
   - Build will use same process as local test
   - Should complete in 2-3 minutes

5. **Verify Production**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   # Should return: {"status":"ok"}
   ```
